# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Application using Mistral3

This repository demonstrates the deployment of a Large Language Model (LLM) with a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. It explains how RAG enhances traditional LLM capabilities by integrating external data for more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Overview
RAG combines the strengths of retrieval systems and generative models to provide accurate and dynamic answers. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant external information during inference to enrich its responses. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge.

## Features
- **Enhanced Text Generation**: Combines database retrieval with advanced language modeling.
- **Practical Examples**: Includes examples to demonstrate the workflow.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets for retrieval tasks.
